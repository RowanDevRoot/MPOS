# \<cells-select>

`CellsSelect` provides a base class as well as a `<cells-select>` and a `<cells-option>` custom elements with select & options functionality similar to native select. It provides an easier and convenient way to build selects with encapsulated HTML & custom styles. As it almost does not provide any styles, it's specially aimed to be extended.

As native selects, it can communicate with forms in the same document using standard form attributes. It can receive 'name' and 'form' attributes, as well as 'value' in options. It can have a 'disabled' and 'readonly' state, it can be 'required', and it can receive an 'autofocus' attribute to get focus when component is attached to the document.

## FocusVisible mixin

`CellsSelect` uses `FocusVisible mixin` from `@cells-components`. This means you can use the 'focus-visible' attribute on your component to manage ':focus' styles based on user navigation interface (keyboard/pointer).

```css
:host([focus-visible]) .button {
  ...Your focus styles...
}
```

## Form communication

To be able to communicate with **forms in the same document**, a component which extends from `CellsSelect` must implement `_select` getter in its render method.
```js
  render() {
    return html`
      <style>${this.constructor.shadyStyles}</style>
      <slot></slot>
      ${this._select}
    `;
  }
```

This way, the component will be able to use the same attributes native buttons have to customize interaction with forms: 'name', 'form', 'value' in options...

```html
<form action="formaction" method="get" target="_self">
  <custom-select name="customSelectName">
    <custom-option value="val1">Value 1</custom-option>
    <custom-option value="val2">Value 2</custom-option>
    <custom-option value="val3">Value 3</custom-option>
  </custom-select>
</form>
```
