# \<CellsFocusVisibleMixin>
## Shows a focus indication if and only if the keyboard is active.

The keyboard is considered to be active if a keyboard event has occurred

This is loosely modeled after the proposed  [focus-visible](https://github.com/WICG/focus-visible) feature for CSS.


CellsFocusVisibleMixin provides a ```[focus-visible]``` attribute for visual effect.

Example:
 ```css
  :host(:not([focus-visible])) button:focus{
    background-color:#1464A5
  }

  :host([focus-visible]) button:focus{
    outline: 2px solid #043263;
  }
 ```
