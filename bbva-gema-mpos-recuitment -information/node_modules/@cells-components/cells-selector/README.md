## &lt;cells-selector&gt;, `CellsSelectableMixin`, `CellsMultiSelectableMixin`

`cells-selector` is an element which can be used to manage a list of elements
that can be selected. Tapping on the item will make the item selected. The
`selected` indicates which item is being selected. The default is to use the
index of the item. `iron-selector`'s functionality is entirely defined by
`CellsMultiSelectableMixin`.

It's directly based on Polymer iron-selector. See: [Documentation](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/iron-selector),
  [Demo](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/iron-selector/demo/demo/index.html).

`CellsSelectableMixin` gives an element the concept of a selected child
element. By default, the element will select one of its selectable children
when a ['tap'
event](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/devguide/gesture-events#gesture-event-types)
(synthesized by Polymer, roughly 'click') is dispatched to it.

`CellsSelectableMixin` lets you ...

  - decide which children should be considered selectable (`selectable`),
  - retrieve the currently selected element (`selectedItem`) and all elements
    in the selectable set (`items`),
  - change the selection (`select`, `selectNext`, etc.),
  - decide how selected elements are modified to indicate their selected state
    (`selectedClass`, `selectedAttribute`),

... among other things.

`CellsMultiSelectableMixin` includes all the features of
`CellsSelectableMixin` as well as a `multi` property, which can be set to
`true` to indicate that the element can have multiple selected child elements.
It also includes the `selectedItems` and `selectedValues` properties for
working with arrays of selectable elements and their corresponding values
(`multi` is `true`) - similar to the single-item versions provided by
`CellsSelectableMixin`: `selectedItem` and `selected`.

Examples:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script type="module">
      import '@cells-components/cells-selector/cells-selector.js';
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <cells-selector selected="0">
      <div>Item 1</div>
      <div>Item 2</div>
      <div>Item 3</div>
    </cells-selector>
  </body>
</html>
```

```js
import {LitElement, html} from 'lit-element';
import '@cells-components/cells-selector/cells-selector.js';

class ExampleElement extends LitElement {
  render() {
    return html`
      <cells-selector selected="0">
        <div>Item 1</div>
        <div>Item 2</div>
        <div>Item 3</div>
      </cells-selector>
    `;
  }
}

customElements.define('example-element', ExampleElement);
```
